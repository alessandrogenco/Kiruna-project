# Technical Debt Strategy

## Prioritization

The strategy is to check all issues from the tool **Sonar Cloud** and decide which one has a priority. 
The issues that are faster to fix have a lower priority.

## Task Creation and Assignment

We can create different tasks and split them between all members considering their knowledge and familiarity with the code, so basically if they wrote it.

We can assign many small issues to a single task and only one time consuming issue to one task.
